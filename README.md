# Vector-Embeddings-Retrieval-in-Node.js
Simple demo of how Vector Embeddings and Retrieval work in AI powered applications. 

🚀 You can check out a working demo here: [DEMO]()

# What
Vector Embeddings are crucial to the way AI Systems remember things. You'll see in this demo how the computer is able to convert plain text into semantic groupings and find sections by ideas!

# Why
The powerful building blocks of AI retrieval systems are simple, transparent and open to anyone. You should be aware of how these systems work and not be a blind user!

# Setup
Clone this repo and find out how it works under the hood.
