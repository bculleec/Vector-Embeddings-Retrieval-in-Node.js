Introduction
Field crops are produced in Ontario under diverse soil
and climatic conditions. The goal is sustainable crop
production using proven techniques that include:
scouting and pest management, soil and fertility
management, tillage, variety selection, planting and
harvesting practices. These techniques also take into
consideration the responsible use of natural resources.
These, combined with in-field trials, help producers
determine which practices warrant adoption. Good
agronomic practices are essential for helping Ontario
farmers produce food, fibre and fuel. Successful crop
production is dependent upon many inter-related
management practices. A little good luck and good
weather helps too.
Publication 811, the Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
is designed to be a technical resource for field crop
production. This third edition replaces the 2009
edition. It has been updated with current Ontario
research and production guidelines as approved by
the Ontario Soil Management Research and Services
Committee (OSMRSC), which is represented by
researchers, industry, producers and extension staff.
Some information used in the Agronomy Guide for
Field Crops originates from other sources, including
the University of Guelph, the Ontario Soil and
Crop Improvement Association (OSCIA), the
Innovative Farmers Association of Ontario (IFAO),
seed companies, the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. universities and
other research institutions. Data presented in this
publication — both new and old — represents the
most relevant and current knowledge available.

Integrated Cropping Systems
Sustainable Crop Production
Publication 811, the Agronomy Guide for Field Crops is
organized by crop and by discipline. Each chapter has
detailed information that is current, Ontario specific
and promotes sustainable crop production. Crop
production is not just about one crop or one specific
discipline (e.g., pest management). Crop production
requires an integrated approach that looks at all aspects
of the farm and production practices, with an eye to
maintaining or improving the land.
Sustainable crop production can be defined as
“developing and utilizing crop production systems that
meet the need of present producers without compromising
the ability of future generations of producers to do the
same” (adapted definition from Dr. G. Brundtland —
Director-General of the World Health Organization).
There are three segments to sustainable crop
production: economic, social and environmental.
Economic sustainability focuses on:
• profit/loss of operation
• supply and demand — product marketability
• operation capacity and long-term availability
of resources (e.g., soil)
• maintaining a viable business for the future
Social sustainability focuses on:
• succession planning for the next generation
• ability to engage with and support the community
(e.g., rural/urban)
• maintaining a viable business/family life balance
Environmental sustainability focuses on:
• ensuring continued resources to sustain crop
production activities
• ability to communicate the use of sustainable,
traceable production practices to the public
• maintaining soil health and decreasing negative
impact of crop inputs on the environment
(e.g., nutrient/pest management)
Sustainability = Systems Thinking
v
Sustainable crop production requires an integrated
systems approach. Every field has unique and site-specific
characteristics that influence management, inputs and
profitability. Integrated crop management takes all aspects
of crop production into consideration, including:
• soil management — texture and tillage requirements
• crop rotation
• crop fertility
• nutrient (waste) management
• water management
• crop protection
• wildlife management
• site management
• scouting and record-keeping
• labour/equipment management
• energy consumption
• economic analysis (e.g., determining thresholds for
action, cost of production, return on investment)
The Agronomy Guide for Field Crops covers many
aspects of the sustainable crop production considerations
listed above. Chapter 1, Corn discusses the aspects
of tillage, while soil management, crop rotations
and improving soil health is explored in Chapter 8,
Managing for Healthy Soils. Scouting and record
keeping are covered in Chapter 10, Field Scouting,
while crop fertility and nutrient management are
discussed in Chapter 9, Soil Fertility and Nutrient Use.
Crop protection issues are covered in detail in Chapter
13, Weed Control, Chapter 14, IPM and Protecting
Natural Enemies and Pollinators, Chapter 15, Insects and
Pests of Field Crops and Chapter 16, Diseases of Field Crops.
The paragraphs below summarize how the aspects listed
above integrate into the production of Ontario field crops.
It Starts With a Healthy Soil
Soil health is often described as the soil’s capacity to
support crop growth, without becoming degraded
or otherwise harming the environment. Physical,
chemical and biological indicators are measured to
determine a soil’s health. Physical indicators include
aggregate stability, available water holding capacity, soil
structure and soil compaction. Soil nutrient levels and
soil pH are chemical indicators. Biological indicators
include soil organic matter, microbial respiration and
soil life populations.
In simple terms a healthy soil will:
• have good soil structure, minimal compaction
and resist crusting
• have good drainage, water movement and
water-holding capacity
• have nutrient levels, pH and organic matter
(OM) in the optimal range
• be resistant to wind, water or tillage erosion
• encourage seedling emergence and root growth
• produce uniform crop growth
• have an abundance of earthworms
• have a fresh, earthy odour
• readily decompose residue
Most of the characteristics of a healthy soil have a
direct or indirect link to other aspects of integrated
crop management. More information on healthy soils
can be found in Chapter 8, Managing for Healthy Soils.
Crop Rotation
Crop rotation is an integral part of the crop production
system. A well-planned crop rotation will:
• increase yields
• aid in maintaining or improving soil structure
and organic matter levels
• protect against soil erosion
• improve soil resilience against weather extremes
• provide residual nitrogen from legumes in
the rotation
• help to disrupt insect and disease cycles
• reduce weed pressure
• spread out workload
The basic rule of crop rotation is that a crop should
never follow itself. Continuous cropping of any crop
will increase the buildup of diseases and insects specific
to that crop and will potentially result in heavier
infestations and reduced yields. The more often the
same crop type has been grown in the same field, the
greater the potential risk.
The greatest benefit from crop rotation comes when
crops, including cover crops, grown in sequence are
from different families; monocots (grasses) and dicots
(broadleaves). The fibrous root systems of cereal and
forage crops (including red clover) are excellent for
building soil structure. The advantage of including
wheat in the rotation often goes beyond the wheat
year. Table Intro–1, Management considerations for
various crop rotations provides an example of response
to a crop following various crops in a rotation. More
information about crop rotations can be found in
Chapter 8, Managing for Healthy Soils.

 Introduction
Rotation Economics
The success of a crop is generally evaluated on
economic yield, where inputs and fixed costs are
subtracted from gross profit. Most of the time the crop
is evaluated on a per year basis and includes market
demand as part of the decision making process as to
which crop to grow. A more sustainable approach
to crop economics would look at economic yield by
rotation. This would combine inputs and fixed costs
for all the crops within a crop rotation, divided by the
gross profit of all the crops within that rotation. This
would allow a longer-term evaluation of all the crops
and could often reflect benefits beyond the actual crop
harvested, such as pest management, herbicide rotation
opportunities or soil building practices. As shown
below under Economic Justification for Including Wheat
in a Corn-Soybean Rotation, Dr. B. Deen, University of
Guelph, demonstrates the potential yield benefit from
adding wheat into a corn-soybean rotation.
Economic Justification for Including Wheat in a
Corn-Soybean Rotation
Example: Adding Wheat into a Corn-Soybean
Rotation1
• 2%–6% increase in corn yield
6.5 bu/acre @ $4.50/bu = $29.25
• 9%–14% increase in soybean yield
5 bu/acre @ $12.00/bu = $60.00
• reduction in rotational nitrogen requirement
26.4 lb/acre @ $0.60/lb = $15.84
• other advantages
– tillage reduction
– yield stability
– opportunity to sell straw
– potential reduction in compaction
– improved soil structure
– spread-out workload
Conservative estimate = $10.00
Total additional profit to wheat is approximately
$115.00/acre
Benefits of diversifying a crop rotation include:
• increased subsequent corn yield (average 4%)
• increased subsequent soybean yield (average 11%)
• opportunity for addition of cover crops
• opportunity for manure application
• opportunity for wheat straw sales
• spread workload over growing season
When profitability is assessed on a full rotation basis,
often the economies of scale have resulted in accepting
a lower profit per acre.

purposes only.
Integrating Cover Crops into the Rotation
Resilient crop yields can be maximized by improving
soil health, which is enhanced through the use of cover
crops. Long-term advocates have found that adding
cover crops to their rotation adds a critical amount
of additional carbon to the soil.
Cover crops should be considered as part of the overall
crop rotation and especially on soils with lower organic
matter, or on fields with short rotations and little
return of crop residue or manure. Cover crops can
help to ensure appropriate ground cover over the
non-growing season to help protect the soil. It is
important to know the goal or expected benefit from
a cover crop. The section Matching Cover Crop Choices
to Function, looks at the various reasons for including
cover crops in a rotation and the potential cover
crops that best meet those goals. See Chapter 8,
Managing for Healthy Soils for more information
about cover crops.

Matching Cover Crop Choices to Function
Cover Crop Function Best Choices for Cover Crops
• nitrogen production • legumes — red clover and other clovers, alfalfa, peas, vetch
• nitrogen scavenging • fall uptake — oilseed radish and other brassicas, oats, barley
• winter/spring uptake — cereal rye, winter wheat
• weed suppression • fast growing/shading plants — oilseed radish and other brassicas,
winter rye, buckwheat
• soil structure building • fibrous root systems from oats, barley, rye, wheat, triticale,
ryegrass or clovers
• compaction reduction • most cover crops roots will assist in reducing compaction
• moderate compaction — radish
• more severe compaction requires strong, dense tap roots that grow
over time — alfalfa, sweet clover
• biomass return to soil • fall seeded — spring cereals, oilseed radish
• summer-seeded — millets, sorghum, sudangrass, sorghum-sudangrass
• erosion protection, (wind, water) • most cover crops once well established — winter rye, winter wheat,
ryegrass (well-established), spring cereals seeded early
• emergency forage • fall — oats, barley, wheat, rye, forage brassicas
• summer — millet, sorghum, sudangrass, sorghum-sudangrass,
see Table 3–2 for more annual forage options
• nematode suppression • cutlass mustard, sudans/sorghums (Sordan 79, Trudan 8) pearl
millet (CFPM 101), marigold (Crackerjack, Creole), oilseed radish
(Adagio, Colonel)
Not all cover crops have the ability to suppress nematode populations;
some can act as hosts. Cover crop activity is variety- and nematode-specific.
Tillage and Residue Management
Reasons for Tillage
There are many reasons to perform tillage for crop
production in addition to increasing soil dry-down.
Soil is also tilled for reasons, including:
• weed control
• wireworm and grub suppression
• soil levelling to improve seedbed uniformity
• incorporation of crop residues
• incorporation of fertilizer and manure
• seedbed preparation
The advent of herbicides greatly reduced the need for
tillage to control weeds (except in organic systems)
and the development of equipment to plant into crop
residues ensures that crops can be planted successfully
with little or no tillage. Generally, performing primary
tillage operations in the spring will leave the soil less
prone to erosion than tillage in the fall. It is best to
use the least amount of tillage necessary to achieve
the goal. This will help to keep the soil in place and
prevent movement into water courses.
Considering all parts of the system will improve the
success of any tillage system. For example:
ix
 Introduction
• Spreading residue and chaff evenly at harvest will
improve tillage and planting operations.
• A diverse crop rotation can reduce insect and disease
issues and can increase the potential success with
reduced tillage.
• Adapting the planter or drill for specific soil texture
and/or crop residue type, over and above the
addition of coulters or residue wheels, will improve
seed placement.
A number of different tillage systems are used in
Ontario. These are summarized below. Additional
information can be found in the tillage section of
Chapter 1, Corn.
Conventional Tillage
Conventional tillage in Ontario generally consists of
fall mouldboard or chisel plowing followed in spring
by secondary tillage, usually with a field cultivator or
tandem disc. Most plowing is targeted to an operating
depth of 15 cm (6 in.), since plowing deeper often
results in unwanted mixing of subsoil into the seedbed.
The more uniform and level a field is left after fall
plowing, the greater the opportunities to reduce
secondary tillage costs and improve planter or drill
performance. One disadvantage is that the lack of
surface residue in conventional tillage exposes fields
to greater erosion risks from water and wind. On
complex slopes, tillage can be responsible for causing
large quantities of topsoil to move to lower slope
positions (tillage erosion).
Fall Mulch Tillage
The chisel plow, disc-ripper and discs (either tandem
or offset) are the most widely adopted fall primary
tillage tools in Ontario. These tools usually leave more
residue on the soil surface while leaving the surface
level in the fall, so that single-pass planting (no
secondary tillage) becomes a viable option in the spring.
Vertical Tillage
Vertical tillage is used to reduce any pushing or
smearing action that may be caused by tillage tools.
Many vertical tillage tools are designed to size residue
into more manageable pieces and distribute crop
residue, while causing some soil fracturing and mixing
of soil with residue at the surface. A number of tillage
tools embrace the concept of “vertical” tillage, but
use shallow concavity discs, low profile sweeps and
extensive harrows to provide some additional soil
disturbance — all the while attempting to remain true
to the idea of tillage without significant inversion and
soil smearing.
Spring Mulch Tillage
The best practice for reducing erosion and input costs
is to eliminate fall tillage. Producers working on finetextured soils, where crop residues are high following
corn, wheat or other crops, may be apprehensive about
leaving soils untouched in the fall. Following soybeans
or dry edible beans, there is little justification for doing
fall tillage on most fields in Ontario. Considerations
following other crops include risk of soil erosion,
availability of equipment to handle spring residue
and field drainage. Producer experience with spring
mulch tillage systems has shown that working
undisturbed soils in the spring obtained better results
when using high-clearance tines, narrow teeth and/or
when packers or rollers were used in conjunction with
the field cultivator.
Fall Strip-Tillage
Performing fall tillage, confined to narrow zones that
correspond to next year’s corn rows, has received
considerable attention in the past few years. The strips of
soil are loosened, cleared of residue and often elevated,
while leaving the rest of the field covered with protective
crop residue. The following spring, the strips are drier,
less dense and more suited to “no-till” planting.
Strip-tillage systems also provide an opportunity to
band fertilizers that must be broadcast in a no-till
system. Applying fertilizer using the strip-tillage
system may also replace the need to apply banded
starter fertilizers through the planter. Fall banding of
phosphorus and potassium in strip-tillage systems,
with adequate fertility levels, can produce higher yields
than when similar rates of fertilizer are broadcast in
no-till systems.
Spring Strip-Tillage
Spring strip-tillage offers an opportunity to prepare
fine, residue-free seedbeds in which a planter can
operate. Most spring strip-tillage operations are
restricted to the lighter textured soils but in some cases
medium textured soils that are well drained are suitable
for this one pass tillage option. The spring strip-tillage
operation usually precedes the planter by no more
than 6–12 hours in order to prevent the seed zone
from drying out excessively. Producers have also used
x
Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
spring strip-tillage as a technique for applying all or
part of a corn crop’s nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and
potassium (K) requirements.
From a soil conservation perspective, spring striptillage also offers the advantage of eliminating the
presence of fall strips that can potentially funnel
water and be susceptible to erosion, especially if
implemented up and down the slope.
Deep Tillage
Increasing axle loads of farm machinery, and the
general concern that soils have become more compacted,
have increased the use of deep tillage systems. The
main reason offered for deep tillage is that elimination
of compacted sub-soil layers and/or tillage pans will
promote rapid and deep root growth and improve
drainage. However, in Ontario, subsoils loosened using
deep tillage are often easily re-compacted by wheel
traffic. Moreover, it is possible that deep-tilled soils
receiving wheel traffic end up with poorer drainage
because deep tillage destroyed the natural pores created
by worms or previous crop roots. Deep tillage into
dry soils combined with deep rooted crops (alfalfa,
sweet clover) offer the best opportunity for repairing
compacted soils.
No-Till Systems
In no-till systems, tillage is not used to prepare a
seedbed. Minimal soil loosening in a narrow band
immediately ahead of the seed opener is performed
by planter-mounted coulters and/or residue clearing
devices. Successful no-till crop production is partially
dependent on effective use of alternative production
practices and field management strategies that deal
with yield-limiting factors that otherwise would have
been corrected with tillage.
For successful no-till production it is important to:
• have good soil drainage and water infiltration
• maintain a multi-crop crop rotation
• incorporate residue management to maintain some
soil cover all year
• incorporate weed control strategies without use of
tillage
• manage diseases and insects
• start with adequate soil fertility levels and consider
fertilizer placement
• minimize soil compaction
Field Scouting and Integrated Pest Management
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach
to weed, insect and disease management that uses all
available control strategies to manage pest populations,
keeping them below economic thresholds. This
results in a cropping system that is more resilient to
failures since it does not exclusively rely on the use of
pesticides to control pests. For example, integrated
weed management strategies include field scouting,
tillage and nutrient management practices, crop
rotations and cover crops.
Ongoing monitoring of fields and crops, throughout
the growing season and beyond, allows a farmer to
observe issues and apply remediation in a timely
manner to minimize any negative economic impact,
while improving field operation efficiencies. Some
problems cannot be addressed when observed, but
the information can still be recorded for future use.
While traditionally field scouting has been solely
associated with pest monitoring and management,
it has many other benefits, including:
• pre-planting field walks that identify drainage issues
• post-planting field walks to look at equipment
performance (planters delivering desired population,
depth, placement across the entire unit)
• nutrient management (specific areas with nutrient
deficiency symptoms)
• crop variety selection (evaluation of in-field
comparisons of variety performance)
• scouting as part of soil sampling, which allows
observation of field conditions (erosion, drainage)
outside the cropping window
Additional information about field scouting can be
found in Chapter 10, Field Scouting.
Record Keeping
New tools are available to increase the value of
scouting and to assist in record keeping. With the
adoption of smartphones and tablets, a large number
of apps are available to assist with scouting. Selected
apps should address all the information parameters
of interest and integrate with other software/hardware
systems on the farm. An app that isolates data on
a phone or tablet offers little value. Many of the
crop and whole farm management systems have
developed field apps that integrate with their main
programs. Many of these also take advantage of
Global Positioning Systems (GPS) capabilities to
xi
 Introduction
better identify the location where problems/issues are
discovered. Figure Intro–1, An example of an Ontario
scouting and record keeping smartphone app, is a collection
of screen shots from Pest Manager, an app developed
to aid Ontario producers in identifying pests while
scouting. Pest Manager provides instant management
options, with the ability to map the locations where the
pest was found for record keeping purposes.
Figure Intro–1. An example of an Ontario scouting
and record keeping smartphone app.
The Pest Manager app is an excellent example of a
scouting and record keeping tool for pest management.
The app includes diseases, weeds, and insects of
soybean, corn and cereal crops. Users can map areas of
fields where pests are identified. This tool can help in
the identification of each pest (insect, weed, disease)
and provides detailed information on their life cycle,
impact, action thresholds and management strategies,
including biological, cultural and chemical control
options. Information provided within this app is
only valid for Ontario. When using pesticides, always
be sure to read and follow the labels and warnings.
This app is free to download and is available for iOS,
Android and the BlackBerry BB10 operating systems.
A Systems Approach to Managing Crop Nutrients
How nutrients are managed for crop production will
depend on many other components of the whole farm
operation. The 4R concept of nutrient management
— the right nutrient sources, at the right rate, at
the right time and in the right place — is being
implemented world-wide by industry, researchers,
government agencies, producers and their advisors.
4R nutrient stewardship is an approach that is essential
to the development of sustainable agriculture. Its
application can have positive impacts on increasing
food production in an economically viable manner,
while preserving the environment.
4R stewardship or nutrient management is a systems
approach that considers the following components:
1. Inventory of nutrients on the farm
This includes organic (manure), inorganic,
the nutrients needed by the crop and those
already in the soil.
2. Characteristics of field and farm
Nutrients are managed according to land base
availability, production goals, proximity to water
resources, farmstead layout, equipment availability
and safety concerns.
3. Site conditions when nutrients are applied
Crop requirements and baseline fertility levels
from regular soil testing are used to determine best
application rates. At the time of application, field
conditions are assessed to determine the best nutrient
source and the best option for nutrient placement.
Where manure or other organic amendments are
applied, special consideration is given to odour,
potential nutrient loss and maintaining adequate
separation distance from sensitive areas.
4. Residual nutrients from previous crops
Where legumes are used in rotation, or where
manure or other organic amendments are applied
regularly, credit is given to available nutrients and
is subtracted from commercial fertilizer needs.
5. Nutrient use efficiency
Nutrient use efficiency ensures that the nutrients
are available when the crop requires them,
resulting in reduced nutrient loss and sustained
soil fertility.
6. Production vs. profit
Because maximum yield will not always give the
most profitable yield, crop production practices
should always strive for maximum economic yield.
7. Other farm management considerations
Nutrient management is part of a comprehensive
crop production system that includes soil and
water management, crop rotation, variety selection,
planting techniques, tillage systems and pest
management. How nutrients are managed will
depend on these other components of the whole
farm operation, including some of the social
aspects such as family needs and outside-farm
interests. For additional information see Chapter 9,
Soil Fertility and Nutrient Use.

Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
1. Corn
Corn is widely grown across southern Ontario. Over
the years 2004–2015, grain corn acreage averaged
769,000 ha (1.9 million acres) with an average yield
of 9.53 t/ha (152 bu/acre). An additional 118,000 ha
(0.3 million acres) is grown as corn silage for livestock
feed. Grain corn produced within the province is used
for both feed (55%) and industrial (45%) uses.
Tillage
To successfully produce corn in Ontario, it is
important to consider factors such as soil texture and
crop rotation. Factors that will influence tillage options
include risk of erosion, availability of equipment and
labour and impact on soil health. Soils in Ontario
are usually saturated in early spring, and quick
dry-down is necessary to ensure timely corn planting.
Appropriate use of tillage can increase spring soil
dry-down rates by loosening soil. This improves
drainage and/or reduces residue cover, which
increases rates of soil water evaporation.
The guiding principle behind conservation tillage
and soil erosion reduction in corn production
should be to maintain 30% of the soil surface
covered with crop residue, or living cover,
throughout the entire year.
Soil Texture and Drainage
In Ontario, coarse-textured soils (e.g., sand, loamy
or sandy loams) that have good internal drainage
characteristics show little yield response to tillage
(drainage classification: rapid or well). Even for crops
that leave large amounts of residue cover, such as grain
corn or cereals, there is often little response to tillage.
On heavy-textured soils with relatively slow internal
drainage, tillage can significantly increase the rate of
soil drying and warming. This increases the possibility
for timely planting and rapid uniform emergence.
Table 1–1, Comparison of two tillage systems on grain
corn yield, provides a summary of Ontario tillage
research for corn, following either grain corn or cereals
grouped according to soil texture. Tillage increased
yield about 70% of the time following cereals, grain
corn or soybeans on the medium- and fine-textured
sites with an average 5%–7% yield increase.
Crop Rotation
A good crop rotation can replace a significant amount
of tillage. Table 1–1 summarizes Ontario tillage
research, conducted on medium- and fine-textured
soils, grouped by previous crop. Generally, there is:
• Little corn yield response to tillage following forages.
Including forages in crop rotations improves soil
structure and may eliminate the need for tillage to
improve seedbed tilth.
• Relatively low yield response to tillage following
soybeans when compared to either cereals or grain
corn, which is partially due to lower crop-residue
levels following soybeans in no-till systems.
• High residue levels can reduce early-season soil
temperature, resulting in delayed planting, slower
corn growth and lower yield potential. Tillage
increases corn yield about 75% of the time when
following cereals or grain corn on medium- or finetextured soils, with yield increases averaging 5%–9%.
Other Reasons for Tillage
There are other reasons to perform tillage for
corn production in addition to increasing soil
dry-down rates:
• improved seedbed uniformity, resulting in more
consistent planter performance and faster, more
uniform corn emergence
• incorporation of surface-applied fertilizer or manure,
resulting in increased nutrient availability and/or
use efficiency
• termination and/or incorporation of weed or crop
residue that can serve as hosts to increase populations
of insect pests
• alleviation of soil compaction

Conventional Tillage
Conventional tillage for corn in Ontario consists of fall
mouldboard plowing followed in spring by secondary
tillage, usually with a field cultivator or tandem disc.
Most mouldboard plowing is targeted to an operating
depth of 15 cm (6 in.); plowing deeper often results
in unwanted mixing of subsoil into the seedbed. The
more uniform and level a field is left after fall plowing,
the greater the opportunities to reduce secondary tillage
costs and improve planter performance. The lack of
surface residue in conventional tillage exposes fields to
greater erosion risks from water and wind. On complex
slopes, tillage can be responsible for causing large
quantities of topsoil to move to lower slope positions.
Fall Mulch Tillage
The chisel plow, disc-ripper and discs (either tandem
or offset) have been the most widely adopted fall
mulch tillage tools in Ontario. Tillage research trials
conducted across Ontario over the past 20 years have
generally shown that disking often resulted in more
favourable soil conditions and higher corn yields than
chisel plowing. Table 1–2, Impact of fall tillage systems
on grain corn yield summarizes the corn yield data from
these sites.
Chisel plowing with twisted shovel teeth may leave
the soil quite ridged. This can lead to extra costs in
secondary tillage (more passes), uneven seedbeds and
occasionally excessive soil drying. Using sweep teeth on
all or part of the chisel plow overcomes some of these
problems. Adding a levelling bar or harrows to the rear
of the chisel plow, or timely secondary tillage in the
spring can also avoid this. The same approach should
be considered with any fall mulch tillage operation.
Leaving the soil surface level in the fall allows for
single-pass corn planting (no secondary tillage) to
become a viable option in the spring. This is a good
technique for reducing tillage costs and improving soil
structure. Soil surfaces are often left too rough in the
fall so that multiple passes of spring tillage are required
to make the field fit for planting.
2
Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
Fall mulch tillage systems should leave the soil
surface smooth enough that spring secondary
tillage can be minimized.
Vertical Tillage
Vertical tillage is used to reduce any pushing or
smearing action that may be caused by tillage tools
that engage the ground in the horizontal plane. Many
vertical tillage tools are designed to break apart residue
into more manageable pieces and distribute crop
residue, while causing some soil fracturing and mixing
of soil with residue at the surface (Photo 1–1). Classic
vertical tillage tools include a range of implements
from shanks (parabolic or straight) that generally are
without sweeps or wings, to straight or wavy coulters
that run parallel to the direction of travel. In reality,
quite a number of tillage tools embrace the concept of
“vertical” tillage but have employed shallow concavity
discs, low profile sweeps and extensive harrows to
provide some additional soil disturbance, while
attempting to remain true to the idea of tillage
without significant inversion and soil smearing.
Photo 1–1. Vertical tillage tools are designed to
manage and mix residue with light soil fractioning.
The most effective uses of vertical tillage tools for
corn production fall into three categories:
1) Effective secondary tillage where mulch tillage
has taken place the previous fall.
2) Single pass residue management and seedbed
preparation for corn in lower residue situations
(e.g., after soybeans or winter wheat where straw
is removed).
3) Residue management and shallow tillage in
corn-after-corn rotations where vertical tillage may
occur both in the fall and then again in the spring.
Spring Mulch Tillage
The best practice for reducing erosion and input costs
is to eliminate fall tillage. Producers working on finetextured soils where crop residues are high following
corn, wheat or other crops may be apprehensive about
leaving soils untouched in the fall. However, following
soybeans, there is little justification for doing fall tillage
on most fields in Ontario. Table 1–2, Impact of fall
tillage on grain corn yield, illustrates that even on finely
textured soils, spring tillage alone (two passes of a field
cultivator) was generally sufficient when corn followed
soybeans in the rotation. Other demonstration trials
established on medium- and coarse-textured soils have
shown the same results. Producer experience with
spring mulch tillage systems has shown that working
undisturbed soils in the spring obtained better results
when using high-clearance tines, narrow teeth and/or
when packers or rollers were used in conjunction with
the field cultivator.
When corn follows soybeans, systems that
involve more than spring cultivation do not
produce enough extra corn to pay for the fall
tillage operation.

Fall Strip Tillage
Performing fall tillage confined to narrow zones that
correspond to next year’s corn rows has received
considerable attention in the past few years. The
strips of soil are loosened, generally off-set from the
previous row, cleared of residue and often somewhat
elevated, while leaving the rest of the field covered with
protective crop residue. The next spring, the strips are
drier, less dense and more suited to “no-till” planting.
Table 1–3, Fall strip-tillage for corn after winter wheat
(straw removed), summarizes Ontario research comparing
a trans-till zone tillage tool to conventional and no-till

systems in winter wheat stubble. This data indicates
that on fine-textured soils, strip-tillage in the fall
generally produced higher yields than no-till systems.
Only at the Wyoming, ON location did fall strip till
yields equal those obtained with the conventional
mouldboard system. Subsequent research has
supported the observations shown in Table 1–3, that
on fine-textured soils following wheat, fall strip-tillage
generally resulted in higher corn yields than no-till and
equal yields to those of conventional tillage systems.
Research results have not consistently shown a yield
advantage for fall strip-tillage systems over no-till on
medium-textured soils or when following soybeans.
Early spring moisture measurements on the same
tillage plots generally showed that fall strip-tilled zones
were consistently drier in early May compared to the
undisturbed no-till plots (Table 1–3). Yield responses
in side-by-side trials have not always indicated a
benefit to fall strip-tillage, but producers with large
acreage, poorly draining soils or high surface residues
may gain a consistent benefit from strip-tillage in
terms of planting timeliness, emergence uniformity
and early corn growth. Performing secondary spring
strip-tillage in fall strip-tillage zones has increased
yields in instances where fall strip-tillage yields are less
than those in conventional tillage systems.
Strip-tillage systems also provide an opportunity
to band fertilizers that in a no-till system must be
broadcast. Applying fertilizer using the strip-tillage
system may also replace the need to apply banded
4
Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
starter fertilizers through the planter. Fall banding
of phosphorus and potassium in strip-tillage systems
can produce higher yields than when similar rates of
fertilizer were broadcast in no-till systems. However,
corn yields from using strip-tillage systems to bandapply phosphorus (P) and/or potassium (K) in the fall
have generally been lower than when P and K have
been applied through the planter. This is especially
evident when P and K soil fertility levels were medium
or low.
Spring Strip Tillage
Spring strip tillage offers an opportunity to prepare
fine, residue free seedbeds in which the corn planter
can operate. Most spring strip tillage operations are
restricted to the lighter textured soils, though in some
cases well drained, medium textured soils are suitable
for this one pass tillage option. The spring strip tillage
operation usually precedes the planter by no more than
6–12 hours in order to prevent the seed zone from
excessively drying out. Spring strip tillage has also been
used as a technique for applying all or part of the corn
crop’s nitrogen (N), P and K requirements. To avoid
seed or seedling burn from fertilizer placed in the seed
zone three approaches can be taken:
1. Reduce the amount of fertilizer to rates that
are similar to the planter banded safe rates, see
Chapter 9, Table 9–22, Maximum safe rates of
nutrients in fertilizer.
2. Disperse the fertilizer throughout the strip to
avoid any concentrated zones.
3. Use fertilizer products that are less likely to
cause salt or ammonia injury (i.e., coated
urea). Spring strip tillage systems that include a
fertilizer application option can reduce the cost
and complexity of a typical conservation tillage
corn planter (e.g., no coulters or row cleaners are
required, reduced down pressure requirement and
the elimination of dry fertilizer).
From a soil conservation perspective, if implemented
up and down the slope, spring strip-tillage also offers
the advantage of eliminating the presence of fall strips
that can potentially funnel water and be susceptible to
erosion. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) can further
add to the soil erosion controlling benefits of strip
tillage (fall or spring) if the strips run on the contour
of sloping fields (Photo 1–2).
Deep Tillage
Deep tillage has increased due to heavier axle loads of
farm machinery and the general concern that soils have
become more compacted. The main benefit of using
deep tillage is the elimination of compacted sub-soil
layers and/or tillage pans. Deep tillage will promote
rapid and deep root growth and improve drainage.
However, in Ontario, sub-soils that are loosened using
deep tillage are often easily re-compacted by wheel
traffic. Moreover, it is possible that deep-tilled soils
receiving wheel traffic will end up with poorer drainage
and less favourable root growth. This occurs because
deep tillage often destroys the natural pores created by
worms or previous crop roots.
Photo 1–2. Strip tillage on the contour with GPS can
aid in soil erosion control.
In Ontario, use of the disk ripper to perform
deep, 30–35 cm (12–14 in.), tillage has increased
significantly. Table 1–4, Grain corn yield response to
three tillage systems, summarizes the results of a study
that evaluated corn yield response to deep tillage using
a disk ripper in medium-textured soils. On these
productive soils with little evidence of severe subsoil
compaction, there was little yield advantage and no
economic benefit over a fall strip-tillage system where
soils were tilled at about half the depth. Following
wheat, both the disk ripper and fall strip-tillage
systems produced yields that were 5% higher than
no-till, but all of the yield response from tillage could
be obtained using a fall strip-tillage system with a
tillage depth of about half that of the disk ripper. Some
producers have claimed benefits from deep tillage on
areas with poor drainage or severe soil compaction
(e.g., headlands). The need for deep tillage in Ontario
is often only associated with fields or areas of fields
with severe drainage limitations or soil compaction.

The strip-tillage system has also been presented as
an opportunity for reducing compaction and/or
improving drainage by conducting deep tillage. In
some cases, it has been suggested to till as deep as
30–35 cm (12–14 in.). Researchers tested deep
in-row ripping at sites near Granton and Ridgetown.
Table 1–5, Effects of tillage systems on corn yields
following winter wheat, illustrates that deep loosening
either provided no yield benefit or not enough to
pay for the cost of the deep tillage operation. The
advantage of using a strip-tillage system to perform
deep tillage is that wheel traffic does not occur on the
deep tilled strips until the next harvest. This allows
extra time for the soil to stabilize before it is exposed
to wheel traffic again.

seedbed. Minimal soil loosening in a narrow band
immediately ahead of the seed opener is performed
by planter-mounted coulters and/or residue clearing
devices. Successful no-till corn production is partially
dependent on effective use of field management
strategies which may include alternative production
practices that compensate for what tillage provides in
other systems. For successful no-till corn production,
the following issues must be carefully addressed:
• soil drainage
• crop rotation
• residue management
• weed control
• disease/insect management
• fertilizer placement
• soil compaction
Soil Drainage
Soils experience slower spring drying rates in no-till
systems due to the lack of soil loosening and residue
incorporation associated with tillage. This can delay
planting and possibly decrease the number of days
available for timely planting. Effective tile drainage is
necessary for many Ontario soils to ensure a reasonable
opportunity for timely no-till corn planting. Good
drainage also helps to provide a favourable seedbed
environment for rapid, deep root growth. Producers on
fine-textured soils often discover that successful no-till
is very difficult in fields that are not systematically tile
drained. These fine-textured fields with inadequate tile
drainage will often require some type of fall tillage to
maximize yield potential.
Crop Rotation
In Ontario, no-till corn generally produces similar
yields to tilled systems when following crops that
produce low residues, such as soybeans, dry edible
beans or forages harvested as hay or haylage. For soils
with relatively slow internal drainage, increasing the
amount of surface residue cover can slow soil drying,
and delay the opportunity for timely planting and
conditions that promote fast, deep, early-season root
growth. Improved soil structure and higher earthworm
activity associated with soils following forages may
contribute to the success of no-till corn production
following forages.

Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
No-till corn grown on medium- and fine-textured soils
that follow crops producing high residue often struggle
to achieve optimum yields, regardless of careful
management for other parts of the production system.
If the choice is made to maintain residue cover
following high residue crops such as grain corn or
cereals, some tillage will likely be required. This will
increase the chance of timely planting and maximum
yield potential.
Residue Management
Reducing tillage costs, improving net profits and
enhancing long-term soil health requires decisions
about how best to handle crop residues, particularly
wheat straw. Where no-till or reduced till corn is
to follow wheat, remove the wheat straw from the
field. Table 1–6, Effect of wheat straw levels on no-till
corn yields, summarizes corn yields from tillage trials
where three different levels of straw were left on the
field and corn was no-till planted the following year.
Removing straw from fields, especially in high-yielding
wheat crops and on heavier-textured soils, increased
the potential for no-till corn yields to equal those of
mouldboard plowing.

2 Stubble heights were approximately 25–30 cm (10–12 in.)
except for plots where stubble was cut and removed.
Where straw removal is not an option, uniform
spreading of the straw and chaff is critical for
no-till or reduced tillage success in corn. Even where
straw is to be left in the windrow, it is important
to spread the chaff as widely and evenly as possible
during combining. In cool, wet springs, the lower
soil temperatures, poorer growth and potential slug
damage brought on by mats of decaying wheat residue
often result in yield losses that may have been avoided
by uniform spreading of residue.
The benefits of incorporating all of the straw might
outweigh the advantages of reducing tillage. For farms
where erosion potential is higher, adopting a reduced
tillage system is likely more sustainable, even with the
need to remove some straw. Another option is using
a system where wheat fields receive a small amount of
tillage to partially incorporate straw while still leaving
the soil surface largely protected.
Researchers examined the impact of adding nitrogen
to assist in straw breakdown. Results indicate that
straw did not decay more quickly where nitrogen was
spread on wheat straw in the fall. In addition, the soil
nitrogen levels the following spring were not higher
compared to where no nitrogen was applied.
Weed Control
For corn yield potential to be realized, optimum weed
control is required. Additional management in no-till
cropping systems may be needed to control perennial
weeds and weed species that are new to the system
due to a shift in weed populations. Spring pre-plant
burndown treatments are critical in allowing the crop
to develop without weed interference during critical
early growth phases.
Disease and Insect Management
Tillage can play a role in preventing or suppressing
certain pest and disease issues. Weeds, volunteer plants
from the previous crop and certain cover crops left on
the soil surface through the winter and early spring
can increase the risk of some insect pests. Low lying
weeds such as chickweed are ideal for egg laying by
black cutworm moths that fly in from the southern
United States (U.S.) in early spring. Cereal aphids
can transmit vector viruses from volunteer wheat
plants and infect the newly planted cereal crop. Corn
planted into a rye cover crop increases the risk of
7
 1. Corn
armyworm infestations. Achieving good weed and
cover crop management through herbicide applications
in the fall and tillage in early spring at least 3 weeks
prior to planting can avoid some of these pest risks.
Tillage can be used in attempts to reduce populations
of wireworms and grubs by bringing them up to the
soil surface, exposing them to their natural enemies.
However, caution is warranted as several passes are
required and may not provide adequate control. Tillage
can actually increase the risk of one particular pest,
seedcorn maggot, if weeds, manure or cover crops
are incorporated into the soil shortly before planting.
Incorporation needs to occur at least 3 weeks prior
to planting to ensure that the adults are no longer
attracted to the decaying vegetation.
Some diseases are more prone to no-till systems as
tillage can help in disease management. Tillage helps
the soil to warm up and dry quickly, reducing the risk
of seedling diseases. Some stalk rot diseases can also
be managed through tillage though in some cases,
crop rotation and hybrid selection play a larger role
in disease management.
More details on insect pests and diseases of corn can be
found in Chapter 15, Insects and pests of field crops and
Chapter 16, Diseases of field crops.
Fertilizer Placement
Nutrient stratification (nutrients concentrated near
the soil surface) may occur in long-term, no-till fields.
Without the option to incorporate or mix dry fertilizer
material in the no-till system, fertilizer placement
becomes increasingly important.
Studies done in Ontario and the U.S. cornbelt have
shown that applying phosphorus and potassium
in starter fertilizer bands resulted in yield response
in no-till systems to be similar to fall mouldboard
systems. This is especially evident in cases when soil
tests indicated low to medium soil fertility levels of
K. Planter-banded phosphorus and potassium were
utilized more efficiently compared to fall surface
broadcast in no-till systems. However, on sites with
low fertility, a combination of broadcast and planter
banding may be necessary to maximize no-till yields.
Cooler- and less-aerated soils in no-till systems often
have a slower rate of nitrogen mineralization compared
to conventional tillage systems. This is often overcome
by applying 35 kg/ha (30 lb/acre) of nitrogen in the
starter fertilizer.
Applying 35 kg/ha (30 lb/acre) of nitrogen in the
starter on no-till corn planters has often overcome
the slower nitrogen mineralization frequently
present in no-till soils, where the balance of the
nitrogen is applied in a side-dress application.
Soil Compaction
The best option for preventing soil compaction is
to avoid field operations when soils are wet. Soil
compaction is often cited as one of the reasons no-till
corn may yield less than conventionally tilled corn.
An option for enhancing corn yields in reduced tillage
systems may include incorporating deep rooted crops
into the rotation, and/or extensive loosening of soil
deeper into the soil profile. This can be done without
disrupting much of the crop residue on the soil surface
and can be confined to zones where next year’s corn
rows will be planted (e.g., strip-tillage).
Usually the most effective method to minimize the risk
of deep compaction, 35–45 cm (15–18 in.) depth is to
reduce the number of field operations and/or minimize
use of equipment with heavy axles (e.g., grain buggies)
wherever possible. Avoiding field traffic when soils are
wet will also help minimize compaction.
Tire management can help reduce soil compaction in
the root zone (top 20 cm (8 in.). Increasing floatation
by minimizing inflation pressures can reduce the
impacts of tires, especially in the surface soil layers.
This requires three key steps:
1. Know the axle load that each tire is carrying.
2. Know the manufacturer's specifications for
that tire.
3. Adjust inflation pressures down to the minimum
acceptable pressure for soil conditions (speed, load
type, duals, etc.). A good target for tire inflation
pressures to reduce soil compaction is 1 Bar
(14.5 PSI).

Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
Planter Performance
Optimal planter performance is necessary to maximize
corn yield potential in any tillage system. Planter
performance and/or suitability are especially critical
in no-till systems. Absence of tillage results in greater
variability in near-surface soil properties and residue
cover, therefore ensuring that planting equipment is
properly maintained and adjusted for no-till planting
conditions will lessen variability in corn plant stand
and emergence, and increase yields in no-till systems.
Hybrid Selection
Maturity Ratings
Corn development is driven primarily by temperature,
especially during the planting-to-silking period. Unlike
soybeans, day length has little effect on the rate at
which corn develops. The Ontario crop heat unit
system has been developed to calculate the impact of
temperature on corn development. Ontario crop heat
units (CHUs) are calculated based on daily maximum
and minimum temperatures and allow for a numerical
rating of growing seasons, geographical locations
and corn hybrids. This system allows producers to
select hybrids that have a high probability of reaching
maturity before a killing frost occurs.
Ontario Crop Heat Units
CHU calculations require a start date, a formula for
calculating CHU based on daily temperatures and an
end date. Starting in 2009, Ontario began recording
CHU on May 1, regardless of location or temperatures
experienced up to that date. The CHU system uses a
calculation to arrive at a daily CHU total and employs
the following trigger to mark the season end: when
average temperature falls below 12°C or the first
occurrence of -2°C. The current CHU system and map
(sometimes referred to as CHU-M1 because of the
May 1 start date) are based on data from the 1971–
2000 time period. The CHU map for Ontario is found
in Figure 1–1, Crop heat units (CHU-M1) available for
corn production.
Other jurisdictions use different systems for
quantifying the effect of temperature on corn
development and for rating corn hybrid maturity.
Unfortunately, these systems are unique, and true
mathematical conversions from one to the other
are not possible. Table 1–7, Approximate conversions
between three systems of measuring heat accumulation
in a growing season provides values to assist in making
reasonable comparisons between the different systems.

It takes approximately 75–80 crop heat units
to produce each corn leaf. Therefore, at
temperatures of 30°C during the day and 20°C
at night, there is one new leaf every 2–3 days. At
20°C during the day and 10°C at night, one new
leaf appears every 5–6 days.
Producers who record daily high and low
temperatures can use Table  10–4, Daily crop
heat unit accumulations based on maximum and
minimum temperatures to calculate CHU for their
own farm.

Selecting the Most Profitable Hybrids
Hybrid selection is probably the single most important
management decision in determining cropping
profitability. Corn hybrids with superior yield
potential have been continuously introduced into the
market place over the past 50 years. Yield increases
of approximately 1.5% per year have been achieved.
To remain competitive, producers must introduce
new hybrids to their acreage on a regular basis. The
following are a few key considerations intended as
general guidelines for selecting hybrids. Fine-tuning
hybrid selection for an individual farm should be done
in consultation with seed company representatives.
Maturity and CHU-M1
Physiological maturity (black layer) is achieved when
all the kernels have reached their maximum dry matter
accumulation and there is no additional moisture or
nutrient transport from the plant. Using crop heat
unit ratings, hybrids can be selected to reach black
10
Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
layer before traditional season-ending frosts occurs.
Figure 1–1, Crop heat units (CHU-M1) available for
corn production, or farm records will provide the heat
units normally accumulated in a given area.
Highest Yield
In any given hybrid performance trial, there may be
a 1.9–2.5 t/ha (30–40 bu/acre) difference in yield
between the highest- and lowest-yielding hybrids.
This emphasizes the importance of obtaining reliable
information on hybrid yield potential and adaptability.
Producers must be able to sort through information
from several key sources: public performance trial data,
strip trial data (seed company or farm organization)
and on-farm comparisons.
The Ontario Corn Committee (OCC) conducts
corn hybrid performance trials each year across
the province. These performance trials include the
majority of available hybrids. Generally, these trials are
set up so that a given set of hybrids, for a certain heat
unit range, are tested at three to four locations. This
data is available at www.gocorn.net and can be viewed
in several formats to allow for stakeholders to carefully
examine the results. These trials give a good indication
of yield potential; however, they are limited to a few
locations and therefore do not adequately evaluate
hybrid adaptability over a wide range of conditions.
For this information, producers need to turn to strip
trials that are conducted on a larger number of sites
across a wide range of environments. Seed companies
summarize these strip trial results which are made
available through their seed guides.
Many producers find it valuable to have corn hybrid
strip trials or comparisons on their own farm. This
allows new, high-yield potential hybrids to be tested
against those proven performers in the farming
practice. However, it is important to remember that
reliable hybrid selections require more than one test
site, even if that site is on the producer’s own farm.
Producers should look for 2‑year data that originates
from many sites (preferably more than 30) before
making decisions about hybrids that will be planted
on a significant portion of their acreage.
One way to look at hybrid selection is to define two
groups of hybrids for a farm operation. The first
group is “New Hybrids” and is comprised of the
most promising new hybrids in the market place.
This group will represent hybrids that are grown on a
relatively small acreage and that are tracked carefully
for their performance on a given farm, in strip trials
and in public performance trials. The goal is to quickly
identify the top hybrid in this group and move it
into the second hybrid group which is called “Tested
Hybrids”. The Tested Hybrids group represents hybrids
that have proven their performance and are grown on
a large percentage of a given operation’s corn acres.
Producers who make the most accurate and quickest
decisions to move new, higher performing hybrids into
their operations will achieve maximum competitive
advantage and yield increases.
Producers who make the most accurate and
quickest decisions to move new, higher performing
hybrids into their operations will achieve maximum
competitive advantage.
Hybrid Positioning
Corn hybrids have often been classified with various
terms such as “workhorses” or “racehorses”, having
offensive versus defensive natures. Hybrids that
produce above-average yield under good conditions,
but perform below average under poor conditions
are considered racehorses (offensive). Hybrids that
have relatively consistent yields in both low- and
high-yielding conditions are considered workhorses
(defensive). As site-specific management increases
in popularity, many producers will choose racehorse
varieties in the most productive areas of their field and
workhorse varieties where soil or weather conditions
are less favourable. Trends within the seed industry
indicate that hybrids will be increasingly defined
for their ability to fit into certain management
strategies and/or environments. Precision agriculture
technologies can better define the potential for hybrids
to exploit site specific resources more effectively.
Producers should be aware of the possibility of
selecting hybrids that will respond more effectively to
higher or lower input strategies. Producers can avoid
some of the risk associated with hybrid selection by
taking time to investigate a hybrid’s past performance.
Select hybrids that complement each other, because they
have different weaknesses for specific characteristics.
For example, when selecting two long-season hybrids
with high yield potential for earliest planting, ensure
that they do not both score relatively low for resistance
to the leaf diseases.
11
 1. Corn
Standability
Select hybrids that have suitable maturity ratings
and outstanding yield potential. Selecting for hybrid
standability is also recommended. This trait is
particularly important where significant field drying
is expected. If drying facilities are available on the
farm and harvesting at relatively high moisture levels
(>26%) is an option, standability may be less critical.
Traits associated with improved hybrid standability
include resistance to stalk rot and leaf blights, genetic
stalk strength (a thick stalk rind), short plant height,
lower ear placement and above average late-season
plant health. Plant intactness or late-season plant
health ratings also indicate better harvestability ratings.
One of the most significant advancements in improved
standability has been the introduction of Bt hybrids
that are resistant to a range of corn feeding pests. All
producers using Bt hybrids are required to plant a refuge
which contains corn plants that are not genetically
modified in order to prevent a build-up of resistant pest
strains. Producers can now purchase refuge incorporated
blends that contain both Bt and non-Bt seed in the
same bag, eliminating some of the issues with having
to plant separate refuge. For further information on Bt
corn refer to Chapter 15, Insects and Pests of Field Crops
as well as the Canadian Corn Pest Coalition website
at www.cornpest.ca.
Harvest Moistures and Drying Costs
Hybrid selection may also be influenced by the
producer’s target harvest moistures. In situations
where corn is stored as high moisture grain (e.g., 28%
moisture), producers have an opportunity to maximize
returns by growing full-season, high-yielding hybrids.
If corn is dried during storage, evaluate the impact
that high harvest moistures may have on net returns.
For example, any potential gains in net returns from
a hybrid that yields 0.31 t/ha (5 bu/acre) greater than
another should be balanced against increased drying
charges. OCC performance trial data has shown that
when corn is planted early, aggressive hybrid selection
(i.e., full-season and beyond) often results in yield
advantages over hybrids that mature in less days
(shorter-season hybrids). The increased yield from fullor long-season hybrids more than compensates for the
increased drying costs due to higher harvest moistures.
Producers should evaluate net returns for hybrids after
dryings costs. Depending on drying costs a 2–3 bushel
per acre increase in yield often more than compensates
for an additional 1% increase in harvest moistures.
Selecting Hybrids for Silage
When choosing hybrids specifically for whole-plant
silage, a yield advantage can usually be obtained by
selecting hybrids rated 100–200 heat units higher than
those selected for grain. Select hybrids for high silage
yields with improved digestible energy. Silage‑only
and dual-purpose corn hybrids are available on the
market. Dual‑purpose hybrids offer grain harvest as an
option, providing more flexibility when the silo is full.
Without sufficient independent data, it is very difficult
to compare and select corn silage hybrids between
companies. Choose top hybrids that have strong
ratings for silage yield and quality. Various models are
used to compare the economic value of corn silage
hybrids. The University of Wisconsin has developed
“milk per acre” and “milk per ton” calculations using
their Milk 2006 model to combine the traits of silage
yield, digestibility, fibre, starch, crude protein and
intake potential into single measures. Milk per ton
measures quality, while milk per acre combines yield
and quality.
Switching to Shorter-Season Hybrids
Field conditions may delay planting and necessitate
switching to less than full-season hybrids. Factors to
consider in this decision include yield potential of
shorter-season hybrids, test weight concerns, drying
costs and late-season harvesting capabilities.
Grain corn obtains 90% of its total grain weight by the
time it reaches one-half milk line, a maturity stage that
even late-planted, full-season hybrids reach in most
years. Switching to shorter-season hybrids may be a
reasonable alternative from a grain yield perspective if
earlier maturing hybrids can produce within 10% of
the full-season hybrid’s yield. Generally, this is a more
favourable proposition in longer-season areas.
Growing full season 3,000 CHU-M1 hybrids allows
for switching to hybrids that are 100–150 heat units
less without sacrificing excessive yield. If the full-season
hybrids are in the 2,800 CHU-M1 range, the odds
of dropping to a hybrid 100 heat units less without
giving up more than 10% yield are low.
Extensive research across the northern cornbelt defines
the optimal date when producers should switch
away from full-season hybrids. Some of this data is
summarized in Table 1–8, Recommended dates to switch
from full-season hybrids across various heat unit zones.
12
Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
This collection of long-term data took into account
yields for hybrids of various maturity ratings as
well as deductions for test weight and drying. The
switch date indicates the planting date when earliermaturing hybrids surpass full-season hybrids in terms
of net returns (gross returns less drying and test
weight deductions).

Switches on Long-Term Data. Pioneer Hi-Bred Ltd.
Growing hybrids with a range in maturity provides
some buffer against stresses at silking time and
end-of-season risks. However, making significant
adjustments to shorter season hybrids should not be
considered until May 30–June 1 for areas in southwest
(>3,200 CHU-M1); until May 20–25 for the midmaturity corn growing areas (2,800–3,200 CHU-M1)
and until May 15–20 in the shorter-season areas
(<2,800 CHU-M1).
A general rule has been to reduce hybrid maturity
by 100 CHU for every week that planting is delayed
beyond the cut-off date for full-season hybrids.
Test Weight Concerns
Lower test weights often result if end-of-season frosts
occur before late-planted corn has reached maturity
(black layer). Consider test weight potential when
selecting hybrids for planting in a late spring. Potential
dockage from delivering lower bushel weight corn to
an elevator or end user is shown in Table 1–9, Grain
corn test weights and potential dockage.
Table 1–9. Grain corn test weights and
potential dockage

considerably depending on year and location.

Farming operations that handle and feed all of their
own corn may be unaffected by test weight concerns
and may choose to remain with full-season hybrids
longer into the planting season. Experience and
research from 1992, 2000 and 2014 indicated there
was little or no correlation between test weight and
livestock feed value. Producers who deliver all their
corn to elevators or processors may want to switch to
earlier hybrids to increase the potential for suitable
test weights at harvest. Producers in shorter-season
areas who fear significant yield losses by switching to
earlier-maturing hybrids may consider staying with
full-season hybrids but switching to hybrids that have
higher test weight scores.
Harvesting
Remaining dedicated to high-yielding, later-maturing
hybrids may present some logistical harvest issues.
Fields planted to potentially delayed hybrids should
be well-drained and have good load-bearing capacities
to facilitate late-season harvesting in less than ideal
conditions. Avoid planting later-maturing hybrids
in areas of the province that are more prone to
snow in November. The snow adheres to leaves
and husks, delaying harvest until the snow melts
from the corn plants.
13
 1. Corn
Planting
Seeding Date
The best yields in Ontario are usually obtained from
corn planted in late April and the first half of May,
as the crop is able to use the full growing season.
Early planting also results in earlier maturity in the
fall, reducing the risk of damage from an early fall
frost or adverse weather at harvest. The influence of
planting date on corn yield is illustrated in Table 1–10,
Expected grain yield due to various planting dates. Most
noteworthy is the rapid decline in yield for the shorter
season areas compared to longer season areas as planting
dates are delayed.
Depending on the total number of days required to
plant the farm’s entire corn acreage, it is generally
necessary to start planting corn before the optimum
date. Producers wanting to plant corn significantly
earlier than optimum dates (i.e., April 15–25) should
consider that soil temperatures need to reach 10°C
before germination and emergence will occur. The
average daily temperature is estimated by taking a
temperature measurement close to 11:30 a.m. using
a 10 cm (4 in.) soil thermometer. Early planting
of a portion of the corn crop can be considered if
average soil temperatures are at or above 10°C, the
soil conditions are favourable and the weather forecast
is predicting average to above-average temperatures.
It is generally advised to pay less attention to soil
temperature and to plant as soil moisture conditions
permit after April 26 in areas receiving greater than
3,000 CHU-M1 or May 1 in areas <3,000 CHU-M1.
In general, the loss of potential yield associated with
planting 2–3 weeks before optimum planting date is
less than the loss associated with planting 2–3 weeks
after the optimum planting date.
Population
Plant populations referred to in this section are the
suggested final plant stands, see Table 1–11, Seed
spacing to achieve various populations. Since not all
seeds emerge, it is necessary to seed at slightly higher
rates. When planting early in the season or when the
soil is cold, a seeding rate 10% higher than the desired
final stand is suggested. When soils are warmer, an
adjustment of 5% is sufficient.

Agronomy Guide for Field Crops
In Ontario, corn is commonly grown at plant
populations of 69,200–88,900 plants/ha
(28,000–36,000 plants/acre). These populations
maximize light interception and can produce good
yields over a wide range of growing conditions without
excessive lodging. In recent years, hybrids have been
developed that tolerate higher plant densities without
excessive lodging or barrenness. When old and new
hybrids are grown side by side under very low plant
populations, their yields are almost identical. Higher
yield responses are obtained when newer hybrids are
grown at higher densities. Much of the historical
yield improvement has resulted from developing
hybrids that excel under higher densities. Some
of the most recent hybrids have economically
optimum populations of 79,000–98,800 plants/ha
(32,000–40,000 plants/acre). Refer to seed company
data to fine-tune hybrid management and planting
density decisions.
On drought-susceptible fields where water availability
is the yield-limiting factor, the yield potential
may not cover the cost of higher seeding rates. In
these situations, adjusting populations downward
can achieve some savings. Higher populations are
warranted as yield potential increases. One study
indicated that for every 0.94 t/ha (15 bu/acre) increase
in a field’s (or portion of a field’s) yield potential,
economically optimal populations increased by
1,112 plants/ha (450 plants/acre).
In Ontario, it is common to aim for higher average
final plant stands than that of the U.S. midwest. The
most productive fields should be near the upper end
of the plant population range for the hybrids being
planted. In shorter-season areas of the province, where
smaller-stature hybrids are grown, producers should
consider even higher populations to maximize light
interception and optimize yields. Yield increases
from increased plant densities have generally been
lowest in the longer-season regions of Ontario (over
3,200 CHU-M1 heat units).
Corn silage plant populations are often promoted as
needing to be higher (10%) than grain corn. Research
from Cornell University disputes this, showing no
advantage to having plant stands of more than 86,500
plants/ha (35,000 plants/acre) for any of the hybrids
tested. The research predicted that as hybrid populations
increased, silage digestibility declined. Optimum plant
populations may be very hybrid specific due to the
genetic diversity among silage hybrids.
Planting Depth
The first rule of corn planting is to plant into moisture
(25%–50% or near field capacity). However, a few
other considerations allow for some fine-tuning of
planting depth. Shallow planting of corn (less than
3 cm (1.2 in.) deep), even into moisture, may lead to
less favourable positioning of the growing point and
first nodal roots (Photo 1–3). This may lead to rootless
corn syndrome in some cases and predisposes the seed
to greater injury from herbicides. Coarse-textured soils
that dry rapidly at the surface will also be more prone
to poor root establishment with shallow plantings.
Optimum corn planting depth means always
placing the seed in moisture. Be sure to check
that even if the corn planter is set at a target
depth of 4–5 cm (1.6–2.0 in.), that no seed in the
field is less than 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) deep.
In contrast, planting deeper at 5.7–8.2 cm (2.25–3.25 in.),
especially when soils are cold early in the planting
season, can delay emergence compared to planting at
depths of 4–5 cm (1.6–2.0 in.). Delayed emergence
can lead to increased risk of insect feeding or seedling
diseases. As the planting season progresses and as soils
warm and dry, ensure that the corn seed is placed
firmly into moisture and planted at a target depth of
5 cm (2 in.). When planting is extended and soils
warm, planting at depths of 7.5 cm (3 in.) in order to
find moisture is often less risky than planting shallower
and hoping for rain.
Photo 1–3. Uneven planting depth. Uniform seeding
depth is critical to achieving uniform emergence.

 1. Corn
Physiologically speaking, a corn seed that is placed into
moisture at 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) deep will have excellent
performance. The challenge comes when a corn planter
is set to deliver seeds at 3.8 cm deep and due to planter
row-unit bounce or some areas of the field with a seedbed
that is rough, uneven or compacted will have some seed
planted too shallow for good emergence. Therefore, it is
often advisable to set the planter slightly deeper to avoid
having any seeds that are less than 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) deep.
Planting depth can be evaluated well into the growing
season by carefully excavating the plant, removing
the nodal roots, and identifying the mesocotyl. The
mesocotyl is generally a white, mostly hairless structure
that runs from the seed to the crown. Measuring the
length of the mesocotyl and adding 1.9 cm (0.75 in.)
results in an accurate assessment of planting depth.
Corn Development
The vegetative and reproductive growth stages in corn
are described in Table 1–12, Vegetative growth stages in
corn and Table 1–13, Reproductive growth stages in corn.
CHU-M1 Season-Ending Dates
The end of the growing season is defined as the
first occurrence of a killing frost (-2°C), or the
date when the daily average temperature has
historically (30 year norms) fallen below 12°C. In
the 30 year data used for CHU calculations, the
season is terminated approximately 10% of the
time by an occurrence of -2°C killing frost.
